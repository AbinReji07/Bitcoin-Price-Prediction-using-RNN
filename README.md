# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-RNN
This project predicts Bitcoin prices using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It uses historical price data, normalizes it, and trains an RNN model to forecast future values. The model captures time-based patterns in the data, and predictions are visualized against actual prices to evaluate performance.
